### **1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter was how cashflow underwriting can be utilized to improve the accessibility of credit and improve lives. 

### **2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
I would like to investigate what how I could use income data to further improve assessing one's credit score. Right now, inflows are hard to work with since the variation of people's income differs significantly. Inflows are also not limited to income, as there are Zelle or Venmo transactions, cash back banking systems, tax returns, etc. However, income in and of itself is very useful in determinng how much a person is making and therefore can tell greatly about the probability of one paying back their loans if they have adequate funds. 

### **3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
I think there is an aspect of working with raw data that is extremely informative and helpful in industry that we were fortunate enough to bypass. However, I think that if we did have to find raw data, clean it, and prepare it, it would have been extremely useful technical skills. 

### **4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I’d like to explore graph-based models and feature embeddings to represent relationships between users and financial behaviors more effectively.
